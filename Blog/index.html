            <p>If I could give <b style="color:#04c4d9;">Born a Crime</b> a new title, I’d name it <b style="color:#04c4d9;"> Truth Told Lightly</b>.</p>
            <p>Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime isn’t just a story about growing up during apartheid. It’s a great book that shows laughing through the hard stuff. He talks about a broken system, poverty, racism, and even moments of real danger, but he does it with so much humor and lightness that it somehow becomes easier to take in and harder to forget.</p>
            <p>What struck me most was how he never tells his story with bitterness. He just states the facts with out no excuses and also without hate. That kind of grace isn’t something you see often, especially when people carry pain from unjust systems.</p>
            <p>Trevor’s way of saying “it is what it is” with a laugh doesn’t mean he wasn’t hurt. It just shows he chose to survive differently. And for me, that’s one of the most powerful messages in the book.</p>

        <div class="right-paragraph">
            <p>In a way, Born a Crime feels like it has two main characters: Trevor and his mom. While sharing his own journey, Trevor also tells hers and you can feel just how close they were and how much she shaped who he became.</p>
            <p> One of my favorite lines when he expresses his mom is:</p> 
               <h3>"My mom did what school didn't. She taught me how to think."</h3> 
               
            <p>Throughout the book, Trevor doesn’t just celebrate his mom’s life, he also reflects on what she represents about women and society.
                When he talks about her relationship with his stepfather, Abel, he shares this line:
               <mark><em>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife... but he never fell in love with subservient women... He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."</em></mark> </p>
            <p>Patricia, Trevor’s mom, was fierce, fearless, and way ahead of her time. She didn’t just accept the life society expected of her. She left her parents’ house in Soweto, found herself a “white job” as a secretary, and even got a house in a "white area",something that was almost impossible for a black woman back then.
                Her story shows us that she wasn’t about following the crowd or doing what everyone else thought was normal. She made her own path, broke barriers, and created a better life for herself and her children.</p>
                Even in her marriage to Abel, though he expected her to be submissive like many women were back then, she refused to lose herself. At the same time, she didn’t leave him when she had the chance—which reminds me of the quote by Jean-Jacques Rousseau:
               <mark><em>"Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains."</em></mark> </p>
            <p>Today, we still see these "chains" everywhere when it comes to gender roles. Society sets expectations, and even when someone decides to break free, it’s not just about personal choice, it’s about whether the people around them support that choice too. Freedom isn’t something you can hold onto alone. It needs a community that respects and uplifts it.</p>
            <p>And that brings me back to Trevor’s quote about Abel.
                Abel wanted a strong woman, but he also wanted to control her. It’s a contradiction we still see today. Some people say they love independent, confident partners but once the relationship gets serious, they start feeling threatened. They might admire a woman’s ambition at first, but later, they expect her to "tone it down" to fit into traditional expectations.From what I’ve seen, a lot of modern relationships struggle because of this exact clash. Loving someone means celebrating their freedom, not fearing it. The healthiest relationships today are built on both people being free to be fully themselves.</p>
